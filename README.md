# Basic-Msal-Login
Basic demo showing pop-up and redirect login

Using Typescript and React ([Create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)), this is a quick demo showing how to setup MSAL [Microsoft Authentication Library](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet) on the client.

It demonstrates pop-up, redirect login, how the redirect url is used and how to inject a single `Msal.UserAgentApplication` instance to the spa.
